# Predicting Restaurant Success Using Sentiment Analysis and Rating Trends

**Overview:**

This project aims to predict the future success of restaurants by analyzing their online reviews and rating trends.  The analysis leverages sentiment analysis techniques to gauge customer opinions and incorporates time-series analysis to identify patterns in rating fluctuations. The goal is to develop a predictive model capable of identifying restaurants poised for significant growth or decline, providing valuable insights for restaurant owners and investors.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (or specify the specific machine learning libraries used)
* NLTK (or specify the NLP library used for sentiment analysis)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will produce the following output:

* **Console Output:**  Printed summaries of the sentiment analysis, key rating trends, and model performance metrics.  This will include details like average sentiment scores over time, significant rating changes, and the predictive model's accuracy.
* **Generated Plots:**  Visualizations will be saved as image files (e.g., `sentiment_trend.png`, `rating_trend.png`, etc.) illustrating the trends identified in the data. These plots will provide a visual representation of the sentiment and rating changes over time, helping to understand the model's predictions.
